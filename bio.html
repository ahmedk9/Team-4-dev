				<h2>Welcome</h2>
				<p>Ryan Cleveland Services, LLC was founded in 2010 in response to a different kind of Owner-Contractor relationship necessity.  Specializing in multi-family development RC Services has created a new kind of working relationship between individual owners, development properties, and contractors who specialize in different kinds of tenant improvements.  Retail tenant improvements, build outs, condominium remodels, office renovations, and various property upgrades are a few of the services that we specialize in.  By offering a standard hourly rate and an ‘open books’ approach to project management, owners feel more comfortable working with RC Services than other typical contractors.  All schedules, budgets, profits, overheads, and change orders are discussed openly and without consequence to the owners unexpected cost that often time have a detrimental impact on the working relationship between contractors and owners.  Please browse through our Portfolio and learn about the different ways that we can assist you on your project.  We guarantee you that this approach to construction management will not only keep the overall project cost down, but will also eliminate the most common frustrations dealing with general contractors.</p>

				<h2>Profile</h2>
				<p>RC Services is an owner operated Limited Liability Company.  Specializing in projects under $500,000 we are able to keep all the general condition cost down to a standard project management hourly rate.  Almost all contractors apply General Conditions to their cost that include, Project Managers, Project Superintendents, Foreman, Offices, supplies, insurance, Phones, Vehicle allowance, bonds, and many more.  All of these costs are incorporated in the budget BEFORE profit in even calculated.  RC services include all of these services in a single Manager and doesn’t include profit in the project cost.  This offers owners a significant savings and more importantly, allows piece on mind that RC services is only charging for the actual time associated with the project.</p>

				<h2>Project Management</h2>
				<p>Most owners have a good concept of what they want and how much they are willing to spend.  However, finding a contractor that they feel comfortable working is a difficult decision.  RC Services believes that superior workmanship is an industry standard and bringing that level of quality combined with ability to budget, schedule, manage, and complete each project with the owner’s expectations in mind.  Using an ‘open book’ mentality owner’s have the ability to review all project cost, contracts , and schedules before, during, and after a project so that they understand that RC services doesn’t benefit from over charging it’s clients rather we only benefit from satisfied clients.</p>

				<h2>Consultant Services</h2>
				<p>Many times Owners are very aware of the construction process however they still need some guidance to get facility approvals with Owners Associations, City approved permits, architectural/structural/civil plans, and/or a contractor that is licensed and insured to establish these approvals.  RC services specialize in dealing with Condominium Ownership Associations, Home Owner Associations, Multifamily Management, Retail Owners and other entities that carry strict guidelines for tenant improvements.  We also have an established history working with City and State Planning and Development departments and can give owners and architects valuable insight that can keep a project from being held up during an approval process.</p>
